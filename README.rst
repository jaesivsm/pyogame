Before launching pyogame, make sure you've installed all dependencies and that selenium is running.

If it's all good you can try to launch this command for basic rapatriation :

.. code-block:: console

    python ogame.py <account_key>

Where <account_key> is the name of the key under which you set your parameters in the configuration file.
